# Lab 1

## Write a program in C that fulfills the following requirements:

1. Ask the user, through command line arguments, for a source file and a destination file.

`gcc filecopier.c -o filecopier ./filecopier sourcefile.c destfile.c`

2. The program then opens the source file, reads it character by character, skips all the brackets (braces, square and parentheses) and copies it to the destination file.
